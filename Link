<center><h1>HOROSCOPE</h1></center>
</p>
<p align="justify"> The actual word 'horoscope' is derived from the Latin combination of two words in which 'Horo' means hour and 'Scope' means view, so it is a 'view of the hour. One definition of 'horoscope' is that it is a delineation of particular celestial energies based on heavenly patterns, such as you see in magazines or newspapers. <br><br> As astrologers we refer to the horoscope as the astrological chart of a person or a moment in time, which is calculated from the planetary positions in either the sidereal or tropical Zodiac. The calculations used are based on the date, place and time of birth. That's why a horoscope is so personal, like a fingerprint.<br><br> When an astrologer works with an accurately-timed chart, the energies carried within it are unique to that individual. Be aware that the chart energies of the planets and signs serve as the potential for personal expression within that individual. The horoscope holds within it planets, signs, aspects, houses, and other points that reflect potential characteristics and patterns. It is our free will that allows us to work with these patterns or remold them to be expressed in other ways.<br><br> Many people think that the horoscope writes our destiny in stone. Not so! It shows potentials...how we use those potentials is our personal prerogative. What the horoscope can offer is insight and awareness about these potentials and their uses.</p>

<p>Mar 21 - Apr 19</p>
<p align="justify">WHAT IS ARIES PERSONALITY?</p>
<p align="justify">At their core, Aries do what they want and do things their way. They are unafraid of conflict, highly competitive, honest and direct. An Aries is not weighed down by the freedom of choice, and is perhaps the sign that is least conflicted about what they want. They throw themselves at the world eagerly and without fear. It is one of their most commendable qualities, but also what causes them a great deal of pain and grief. <br><br> Aries are driven by a desire to prove themselves and their strength. They naturally take charge and are competitive and ambitious. Aries are spontaneous and courageous. They have a sense of adventure and love to explore. They’re determined and bold, and are good at initiating new projects. They have high energy and can initiate quick actions. They can also be impatient, but are naturally active and don’t like to waste time.<br><br>While Aries like competition, they don’t like to play games. They are highly self-aware, have strong opinions and are always ready to defend them.<br></p>
<p align="justify">WHAT ARE ARIES WEAKNESSES?</p> 
<p align="justify">Aries tend to be impulsive, impatient, and hotheaded. They do not apologize for their anger. They say “I don’t care” and mean it. They don’t always have the best self-control, so they need to learn how to be more patient.<br><br>Addicted to action and excitement, Aries are often the cause of their own turmoil. All Aries want to feel things intensely, which is why they can sometimes be prone to reckless risk-taking. It also means they are often reacting out of emotion rather than from a place of calm clear-headedness.<br></p>

<center><h3 id="taurus">About Taurus</h3><center>
<p>Apr 20 - May 20</p>
<p align="justify">WHAT KIND OF PERSON IS A TAURUS?</p>
<p align="justify">Taureans are the human equivalent of moss. A handmade wooden chair. They are normally satisfied with the way things are. They embody stability. Sitting in a patch of grass admiring the breeze. When everything else seems to be falling apart, Taureans are an oasis of calm, a rock of dependability. Practical knowledge and experience is their modus operandi.
<br><br>Taureans are oriented around the physical world. They tend to be grounded and logical. They love routine and they’re committed to their own comfort. They like to be in control. They’re patient and steady, and their materialism is an extension of their pursuit of stability.
<br><br>Once they get into a groove, it’s difficult for them to get out of it. Object in motion stays in motion. Object at rest stays at rest. Appreciative of beauty. Attuned to physical pleasure. They like things to be predictable. They are perfectly happy eating the same meal over and over, or wearing the same outfit for a week straight. They would prefer things be consistent than chaotically good. They like to discover what they have the most fun doing, and then do it to the extreme.
<br><br>Tauruses have a regal quality about them. They are graceful and diligent laborers. They can be stubborn, bull-headed, and set in their ways, but they are also great listeners and very dependable.
<br><br>Taurus can absolutely go on forever. They never feel fatigued. They are like machines. And no matter what they throw at them, they will inevitably overcome their obstacles because they’ve already prepared for every contingency. They are the hand-built truck that will never break down. They are the bulletproof vest that never rips.
<br></p>
<p align="justify">WHAT ARE TAURUS BAD TRAITS?</p>
<p align="justify">Taureans’ bad traits have to do with their materialistic proclivities. Sometimes they are overly determined to achieve material success. They are not immune to greed. They can be apathetic to the needs of others if they are motivated to achieve their own goals.
<br><br>Taureans don’t respond to criticism. Not even that they negatively react to it, but it’s almost like they are made of cement, and any feedback just bounces right off. They don’t budge.
<br><br>Taurus are stubborn. They’re not going to do something they don’t want to do. They’re slow to change their minds because change threatens their sense of stability. They can become so set in their routine that they get too comfortable and lose sight of what really matters. Taurus can become emotionally and physically lazy.
<br><br>They can become stubborn and obstinate, and have a hard time listening to other people. They can be like a bull, stuck in the mud, unable to see the bigger picture. They are slow to act, and may be too caught up in the moment to see the potential for something bigger. They can also be reckless, especially when they are young. Struggles with over-indulgence in vices. Doesn’t know moderation. Once they decide they like something, they go all in.

<center><h3 id="gemini">About Gemini</h3><center>
<p>May 21 - Jun 20</p>
<p align="justify">WHAT KIND OF PERSON IS A GEMINI?</p>
<p align="justify">Geminis are very intelligent and pick up knowledge quickly. They are perceptive, analytical, and often very funny. They have an unreserved and childlike curiosity, always asking new questions.
<br><br>Geminis have an uncanny ability to size up a person’s character in a matter of seconds, even if they only just met them. If someone’s bluffing, they’ll be the first to notice. They are great communicators, very responsive and sensitive listeners.
<br><br>Geminis are versatile, comfortable being both introverts and extroverts. They are quick to adapt to the energy of a room. They can be the life of the party or a complete wallflower. They know how to bring dissimilar people together and make them get along.
<br></p>
<p align="justify">WHAT ARE GEMINIS AFRAID OF?</p>
<p align="justify">Geminis are afraid of being alone. This is why they tend to have large social circles and always have a companion. They’re afraid of being trapped in their own minds. It’s not that Gemini aren’t creative or intelligent, it’s that they’re afraid of the power of their own imagination. They’re afraid of what they’ll find once they finally find themselves.
<br><br>They’re not afraid of their emotions, but they’re constantly worried about how they convey them, about their words being misconstrued, about unintentionally hurting someone’s feelings. This is a frequent misfortune of Geminis, and a result of how they externalize their insecurities. They’re afraid of getting caught up in an emotion that they can’t control. They simply react to their emotions, rather than feel them.
<br><br>Their mind is an endless race track. They’re constantly scanning under the surface of their current reality for something that they haven’t seen before. They’re not in a rush to get anywhere, they’re just looking for something new.
<br><br>Perhaps the most important thing a Gemini needs to realize is that there is no final destination to be found at the end of the road. They can’t run forever. At some point they’re going to have to stop and look around. To take responsibility for the environment they find themselves in. They’re going to have to look at the world that they’ve built for themselves and decide if it’s really what they want.

<center><h3 id="cancer">About Cancer</h3><center>
<p>Jun 21 - Jul 22</p>
<p align="justify">WHAT IS THE PERSONALITY OF A CANCER?</p>
<p align="justify">A Cancer’s personality is like wading chest deep in a lake of warm water. It feels sparkling and cool while it’s touching the body, but you know that if you were to dive in, it would feel warm.
<br><br>Cancer’s self-awareness is like the tides. They’re constantly moving in and out of focus. Their personality is layered. They have many moods, some of which are contradictory, but they also have a deep, core self that persists.
<br><br>Cancers are weighed down by their own sorrows and the sorrows of those around them. They are frequently haunted by grief. It’s hard for them to share their pain with others, and they are often afraid to be vulnerable because they carry a fear that people will use their weaknesses against them. Cancers have learned to hide their pain to avoid burdening anyone else. They pretend they’re okay when they’re not.
<br><br>Their emotions are like an exposed nerve. They can feel everything. They’re like a tuning fork that vibrates at the slightest provocation. They tend to carry deep grudges because they can’t forget the emotional sting of a slight.
<br></p>
<p align="justify">WHAT ARE CANCERS ATTRACTED TO?</p>
<p align="justify">Cancers are homebodies. They like the comfort of the familiar. They don’t like change. They are drawn to stability and routine. They like to know what is expected. They tend to be less experimental than other signs. They have an attraction to the past. They like to keep traditions alive. They like art that reminds them of a different time. They love old stories, or old art forms. Predictable environments make them feel comfortable. They like to know what’s going to happen. They like to feel that they’re part of a bigger plan. They don’t like surprises.

<center><h3 id="leo">About Leo</h3><center>
<p>Jul 23 - Aug 22</p>
<p align="justify">WHAT KIND OF PERSON IS A LEO?</p>
<p align="justify">Leos are bold, warm, and loving. They are also the ultimate showmen. They can dazzle with the theatrical flair of a Broadway star and the charisma of a politician. They are captivating personalities. They have a way with words, and can speak eloquently on just about any topic, no matter how quickly they’ve just been introduced to it.
<br><br>Leos inject ambition into everything they do. They are ruled by the heart. They are brash and confident and trust their instincts. Their actions are natural and effortless.
<br><br>Leos have an unrelenting appetite for growth that is easily satiated by the praise of others. When they are hurting, it shows. They will use their anger as a protective wall to shield their vulnerabilities. They want to be perceived as unbreakable because they are scared of admitting vulnerability, needing things from other people, being incomplete.
<br></p>
<p align="justify">WHAT ARE THE BAD TRAITS OF A LEO?</p>
<p align="justify">The bad sides of a Leo appear when their positive and admirable character traits cross over into excess. They can be perceived as overbearing, but this is due to their hyper-presence and warmth.
<br><br>Leos have a reputation for being braggarts. To them this isn’t bragging, it’s sharing. Sharing their accomplishments with others makes them feel connected, and they expect the same in return from their friends. They want to be celebrated but they are equally happy to celebrate you.
<br><br>Leos like to feel important. They don’t necessarily want to be worshipped, or be treated with reverence. They just want to be recognized for their authentic selves. The difference between admiration and worship is subtle, but it’s the difference between a Leo being preoccupied with themselves, or being focused on the good of the people they care about.
<br><br>They want to be the center of the universe. They want to be rewarded for being the best and the brightest. They want to be given special treatment, but also feel deserving of it.

<center><h3 id="virgo">About Virgo</h3><center>
<p>Aug 23 - Sep 22</p>
<p align="justify">WHAT ARE VIRGOS KNOWN FOR?</p>
<p align="justify">Virgos are known for being perfectionists. Clean freaks. They are known for their attention to detail. They can find patterns where there are none. They can be finicky and critical to a fault.
<br><br>It’s true that Virgos are very particular, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they keep neat spaces. Their particularities and habits don’t necessarily line up with traditional views of cleanliness. They could live in what looks like a Tasmanian devil-style dust storm ruin, but still impose a “no shoes in the house” or “no outside clothes on the bed” rule. Maybe their house looks cluttered, but they still know where everything is. Everything has its place. Virgos prefer to exist in organized spaces, but put their service orientation over their own comfort. This can mean that a Virgo is too busy fixing the lives of those around them to put much work into providing for their own needs. They’re rarely motivated by their own self-interest.
<br><br>Virgos are also known for being intelligent, but because of their introverted nature they can sometimes have trouble expressing themselves. Talking to them may feel like floating on the surface of existence, and like you never know what they’re thinking and feeling deep inside. Their emphasis on thoughts and ideas can seem like a cover-up for their lack of emotional depth. In reality, they are a fortress unto themselves—the definition of self-containment. Virgos will be endlessly accepting of whatever you have to share, but may not see the value in spontaneously performing a similar excavation of themselves for anyone else.
<br></p>
<p align="justify">WHAT MAKES VIRGOS HAPPY?</p>
<p align="justify">To be happy, Virgos need to feel like they’re being useful. They feel productive by contributing to something larger than themselves. This is how they derive self-worth. In order to feel like they have value, they need to feel needed.
<br><br>Virgos actively seek out messes—physical, interpersonal, emotional—in order to fix them.They like working on busy little behind-the-scenes tasks that make life run more smoothly for everyone. They need to keep going at full speed, because if they slow down, the unfolding chaos of the world catches up with them and their heads are filled with constant anxiety. Fixing external chaos distracts them from their own internal messes. It’s this internal disorder that Virgos are always running from, throwing themselves at the Sisyphean task of being the world’s dustpan.
<br><br>Virgos need a sense of purpose and achievement. They love setting goals and checking things off their to-do lists. What makes them happy is the feeling that they’re making an impact, or at least trying to.

<center><h3 id="libra">About Libra</h3><center>
<p>Sep 23 - Oct 22</p>
<p align="justify">WHAT PERSONALITY IS LIBRA?</p>
<p align="justify">Libras are difficult to really understand because they seem so contradictory on the surface. They’re simultaneously extroverted and introverted, strategic and spontaneous, focused and intuitive. This variability makes it difficult to pin down their true character. They are an entire constellation of personalities. Libras are different depending on who they're around.
<br><br>This is because Libras value empathy. They are receptive. They can be other people’s mirrors. Because of this, they have strong opinions about other people, but take a long time to understand themselves.
<br><br>They want to be admired not for their talents but for their charm. They want to be seen as the responsible figure who can balance out the turbulent elements around them. They feel an intense amount of guilt and shame when they are unhappy because they know that their unhappiness affects everyone around them.
<br></p>
<p align="justify">WHAT ARE LIBRA'S WEAKNESSES?</p>
<p align="justify">Libras are compassionate and empathetic people. They are willing to go out of their way to help others. They dislike conflict and avoid confrontations. These traits lead them to be manipulated by others. Libras also have a tendency to be indecisive. They are so concerned about other people's feelings that they let other people make decisions for them.
<br><br>Libras put a lot of weight on the opinions of others. Although they are secretly terrified of negative judgment, they have a hard time avoiding the spotlight. They need to be noticed in order to feel validated.
<br><br>What Libras need to discover is that positivity is its own kind of delusion. Libras are bound by the limitations of their bodies and their minds. They are contained within the boundaries of what their five senses tell them. They are able to understand the flavor of the world, but not the color. They’re not able to interpret the underlying micro-signals that others can. The dark abyss of the unknown is a terrifying place for them, which is why they have to pretend that they know everything. They project an air of omniscience. But in truth, they have no idea what they are talking about.

<center><h3 id="scorpio">About Scorpio</h3><center>
<p>Oct 23 - Nov 21</p>
<p align="justify">WHAT IS SCORPIO’S PERSONALITY?</p>
<p align="justify">The Scorpio personality is a profound chasm of infinite complexity (or at least how they project themselves). They are difficult people to get to know. They are psychological trap doors. They socialize from behind a double-sided mirror, always scanning, reading you while you can only see your own reflection. They prefer to be the people asking the questions. They remove your skin with their perceptive scalpel and take inventory of your pulsing viscera. They probe and push. They know the little things that make you tick. Your pressure points. The subtle ways to procure the answer they’re seeking. They are keenly aware of power, its flows, and their position within its matrix.
<br><br>Despite their ability to be generally popular, there’s something very lonely about Scorpios. They have a ruthless view of the world. Eat or be eaten. Every human interaction is a meeting of opposing powerful forces. A clashing of wants and needs where somebody wins and somebody loses. Their knowledge of other people’s internal structures gives them an edge over the competition. They know how to play people against each other. They are forthcoming and evasive at the same time, depending on what is situationally beneficial. They are blunt, but not tactlessly so. They are intentional about the information they reveal. They’re not liars, they do not espouse falsehoods, but they are masters of opening windows on certain truths while concealing others behind heavy curtains.
<br></p>
<p align="justify">WHAT ARE SCORPIOS AFRAID OF?</p>
<p align="justify">Scorpios aren’t afraid of most things other people fear. Not darkness. Not pain. Not death. They confront these truths head on. They know that death is inevitable. Instead of instilling fear, this knowledge is the whetstone that hones their appreciation for life. Scorpios teeter on the fine edge of the unknowable. Life is more interesting that way.
<br><br>Scorpios do fear vulnerability. The feeling of being known. Darkness can be a hiding place. Pain can be an excuse not to trust. When they open up, it gives other people power over them, and Scorpios need to be in control. The illusion of control over themselves and other people is the only thing that makes them feel secure in the face of an otherwise uncertain world.

<p>Nov 22 - Dec 21</p>
<p align="justify">WHAT IS THE PERSONALITY OF A SAGITTARIUS?</p>
<p align="justify">Sagittarius is the ultimate empiricist. They will always choose principles over feelings and will often question who they are. They move from job to job, philosophy to philosophy, belief to belief. They are explorers of the human condition and are unafraid of change. Sagittarians feel like the world is their playground. They love to explore the unknown. They want to understand how the world works.
<br><br>On an unbounded quest to discover the whole of the universe inside of themselves, Sagittarians are unshackled from any particular worldly attachment. They are reckless in their pursuit of what they want, and often end up doing and experiencing things that defy conceptions of the possible.
<br><br>Sagittarius is an explorer. They are both the fearless adventurer and the jaded critic. They understand that knowledge comes in two forms: the shallow, disposable kind that comes from external sources, and the kind that comes from within. Sagittarius knows that external knowledge can be easily gained while internal knowledge is exponentially deeper and more powerful. They’re on a quest to delve into the depths of the universe inside the human mind. They don’t do this to prove that they have all the answers, but instead because they know that the journey is the destination.
<br></p>
<p align="justify">WHAT IS SAGITTARIUS WEAKNESS?</p>
<p align="justify">Sagittarius is a sign of warrior-poets. They hold a firearm in one hand and a book in the other. They encapsulate a relentless drive for freedom. They are one of the most magnanimous and worldly signs in the zodiac. Their boundless optimism is infectious. It can be hard for them to find focus, but once they have their mind set on something they’ll stop at nothing to achieve it. Their ability to overcome insurmountable challenges is testament to their adaptable strength.

<center><h3 id="capricorn">About Capricorn</h3><center>
<p>Dec 22 - Jan 19</p>
<p align="justify">DO CAPRICORNS LIKE ATTENTION?</p>
<p align="justify">Capricorns aren’t consumed by the need for attention, but are not immune to it. They simply don’t indulge in attention-seeking behavior. They don’t want attention for their looks or style or ingenuity. They don’t want to be admired, but they do want to be respected. They don’t want to be the center of attention. Instead it’s like they need to prove their own abilities to themselves.
<br><br>Capricorns are constantly competing with themselves. They do want praise, though. Not adulation, just praise. Praise is a simple acknowledgment of a job well done. Praise is a pat on the back. They use this as validation to compensate for general feelings of incompetence and inferiority. They plow through adversity with blinders on until they reach success.
<br></p>
<p align="justify">WHAT KIND OF PERSON IS A CAPRICORN?</p>
<p align="justify">Capricorns are masters of discipline. The wringing of the hands, the constant reminders, the exacting structure, the ever-increasing goals, the tidal wave of self-criticism that lasts forever. They are the ultimate perfectionist. They can be so absorbed in their own internal monologue that it becomes impossible to get them to look away from themselves. Capricorns are often called “workaholics.”
<br><br>They are incredibly pragmatic. They are rule followers with a highly developed moral compass. From a young age it is impressed upon them that their whole sense of worth and meaning is based on their ability to hunker down and force their way to the finish. This turns them into achievement junkies. Their drive to succeed is a reflection of their fear of failure. The most stressful time in a Capricorn’s life is when they question their own authority. When a Capricorn is in a position of power, they are most stable. When they’re put in a position where they have to cater to someone else’s agenda, they can become a little unhinged.
<br><br>Capricorns collect responsibility. And they always seem to take it all on. Capricorns need to be the one to fix everything. Responsibility is their natural state. They have a “can do” attitude. They are the martyrs and the champions. They are the guardians and the judges. The team captains. The chief of chiefs. The general. The leader. But even as they lead the charge, Capricorns can feel like the loneliest people in the world. They wish to be completely self-sufficient, and are scared of depending on others.

<p>Jan 20 - Feb 18</p>
<p align="justify">WHAT KIND OF PERSON IS AN AQUARIUS?</p>
<p align="justify">Aquarians are archetypical outcasts. This doesn’t mean they’re loners. In fact, they thrive in large groups—charming you with their peculiar senses of humor, intriguing you with fun facts about the history of disposable straws, or convincing you to join their reading group. The alienation they feel is often self-imposed—a result of their knee-jerk contrarianism, rather than a lack of social intelligence. They try to be weird. They hang grapefruit rinds from the wall and call it art, they pretend to actually like noise music, they saturate their internal monologues with SAT words.
<br><br>“Intelligence,” to them, means the ability to formulate the most unpopular opinion possible. If they were white sheep, they’d dye their wool black just to prove a point. They are destined to live their lives in direct opposition to the current world. In fact, they are world-builders. An entire universe exists in their heads, and this universe adheres to its own set of logic that doesn’t map onto reality. They are not liars. They are utopians. They are not cold. They are rational. To them, emotions are just holes in their idealistic vessels. Why succumb to sensitivity when there is so much knowledge to acquire, so many problems to be solved, worlds to invent?
<br><br>They sometimes ask, “Why can’t I be normal?” but in reality, they find normalcy boring, and they stake their self worth on their ability to be interesting. They want to be unknowable. They want to evade definition. Definitions are binding little rules that other people use to restrict their movement, and they must resist anything that infringes on their freedom to drift. Between definitions, between the individual and the common, between themselves and humanity. The ultimate Aquarian struggle is resolving the tension between their need for community, and their need for complete detachment.
<br><br>Aquarians are always running little tests. They live their lives as one big science experiment, using the element of surprise to collect reactions and construct theories about the intricacies of human nature. They are walking abstract art pieces, shattering traditional perspectives with their complete disregard for convention. They are martyrs to the cause of “humanity”, and “freedom” is their only demand.

<p align="justify">IS PISCES A GOOD SIGN?</p>
<p align="justify">If you are asking this question, you’re probably a Pisces who is insecure. If you don’t feel valued, it’s not because being a Pisces is bad, but because society as a whole generally undervalues “soft” skills like intuition and sensitivity. Your challenge is to start viewing these things as talents instead of impediments.
<br></p>
<p align="justify">WHAT IS THE PERSONALITY OF A PISCES?</p>
<p align="justify">Describing a Pisces’ personality can be difficult because Pisces tend to evade distinction. Their behavior changes significantly based on who they’re around. Pisces are just permeable membranes that pensively let things flow through them. They are cerebral sea sponges. They are boundless. They tend to dilute themselves with larger personalities to avoid having to form coherent identities.
<br><br>Most of the qualities usually associated with Pisces (dreaminess, emotionality, imagination) are internal processes that are difficult to observe from the outside. This is because Pisces are primarily inward-facing. They are not self-absorbed, but they are absorbed in themselves.
<br><br>Ultimately, a Pisces wants to dissolve. To wrest themselves of a physical form and diffuse into everything they touch as love. To exist in the gossamer liminal layer that hangs just barely above the material. To live their life like a romantic poem. To understand that reality and fantasy are neighbors on the same infinite plane.
